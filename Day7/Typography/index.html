        <p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, 
            readable and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes,
             line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, as well as adjusting the space between pairs of letters.
